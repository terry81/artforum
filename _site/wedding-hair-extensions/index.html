        <p>Every bride desires to look beautiful and irresistible on her wedding day. Hair is one of the details that clearly distinguishes the nice bride from the incredibly beautiful bride. So, the hairstyle for the biggest day of your life is one o the most important things. At the same time, your natural hair not always has the appropriate length, color and density for the glamorous wedding hairstyle. That’s why the hair extensions can help your hair to be longer, fuller and of course to look completely natural. Take a look at our tips for hairstyle on your wedding day!</p>

<h2 id="select-the-best-quality-hair-extensions">Select the best quality hair extensions</h2>

<p>First of all, make sure that you choose the best quality, natural, human hair extensions and go to a hairdresser who has a lot of experience in this field. Altogether, you have to choose the most suitable for you hair extensions - in terms of length, color and quantity of hair. It would be good if the hair salon offers its own assortment of hair extensions and you can purchase and put them in the same place.</p>

<h2 id="which-hair-extension-method-is-the-best-for-you">Which hair extension method is the best for you</h2>

<p>We have already written about the hair extension methods. We at Art Forum Hair always personally approach each of our clients and we can not say which method is best for the wedding hairstyle. However, experience shows that the tape method with sticker is mostly used. It is discreet compared to other methods and can be worn for 2-3 months. The stickers are waterproof and you can swim and walk on a beach during your honeymoon.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-put-hair-extensions">When is the best time to put hair extensions?</h2>

<p>The experts recommend at least 2 weeks before the wedding day. This time is enough to get used to your new vision, wedding hair trial and change the hair color if you want. With hair extensions you can have the perfect hairstyle on your most special day!</p>
