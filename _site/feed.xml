We at Art Forum Hair offer mainly tape-in hair extensions with lengths 50 and 55 cm. Of course, we can also offer you tape-in hair extensions with length and color to your preferences.</p>

<p>How do we achieve a variety of colors?</p>

<p>When we bleach or change the tape-in hair extensions color we again use our own innovative technology for hair bleaching. The method is unique because it keeps the cuticle - the outermost part of the hair shaft. On one hand, this guarantees the strength of the hair and, of course, ensures a much longer life of the hair. With this method it is possible to achieve any desired hair extensions nuance. Very good results have also been obtained with the modern ombre effect. Furthermore, we use only the highest quality virgin human hair.</p>

<p>Our customers have recently pointed out the main advantages of the tape-in hair extensions. They said that the hair is extremely flexible and natural-like.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flexible</li>
</ol>

<p>The tape-in hair extensions which we offer are extremely flexible compared to the other hair extension methods. One of the reasons for this is that the tape-in hair extensions are put near the base of the hair. Our clients share that they feel comfortable while wearing and brushing their hair. This is also true when they wash and dried their hair. In fact, the maintenance and the care for them are the same as for your own hair.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Natural-like</li>
</ol>

<p>Two main factors are important for the natural-like hair extensions. First, to be made from real human hair and second to have the same color as your own hair. If you truly want flexible and natural-like hair extensions, the tape-in hair extensions are the best solution for you! If you want to check it for yourself, please visit our Art Forum Hair salon!</p>]]></content><author><name>Albena</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The tape-in hair extensions can be used to extend the hair as well as to add extra volume to your own hair.

At the same time, the human hair extensions are ever increasingly demanded and preferred all over the world. Indeed, natural hair extensions have the same structure as your hair, blend very well with it and their life is much longer than the synthetic ones. There are three basic types of human hair extensions that you can choose from. We will start with the highest quality hair.</p>

<h2 id="virgin-human-hair">Virgin human hair</h2>

<p>Virgin human hair is the best quality hair on the market. This hair is obtained from women or young girls who have never treated their hair chemically (color-dyed) or thermal (curling, straightening) with a curling iron nor a hair straightener. Also, very often this type of hair has not been dried with a hairdryer and it is carefully kept under a headscarf. This is the highest grade hair extension and of course the price is the highest. You can do everything which you do with your own hair - color-dyed, straightening and curling.</p>

<h2 id="remy-human-hair">Remy Human Hair</h2>

<p>Almost all online stores claim that they sell only Remy human hair. What does this mean? When the hair is Ramy all hairs in the extension are arranged in the same order from the top to the root and the hair growth is preserved unchanged. Generally, the remy technology guarantees a longer life of the hair extension and protects the hair from entanglement. The lowest quality human hair follows.</p>

<h2 id="non-remy-human-hair">Non Remy human hair</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, in 90% of the cases the claim that the hair is Remy is an advertisement trick to justify the higher price of the hair. The non Remy hair is usually collected from hairdressing salon’s floors and it is impossible for each hair to be properly arranged (the roots in one direction and the ends in other direction). Very soon the hair extensions get tangled and become practically unusable. We hope we have been useful to you and you could already distinguish the different human hair types!</p>]]></content><author><name>Albena</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the latest surveys in the beauty industry reports that in the recent years people who want to use hair extensions have increased by more than 40%.

The main “stress” factors that influence both our natural hair and the extensions are the harmful UV rays from the sun, the sand on the beach, the salt water of the sea and the chlorine and other chemicals in the swimming pools. So during the summer it is extremely important to care for our hair and to avoid its dryness, thinning and loss of shine. Luckily, there is not much effort required or expensive procedures involved. Our mini program of 3 tips will help you for the beautiful look of your hair extensions during the upcoming hot summer!</p>

<h2 id="avoid-hair-products-with-alcohol">Avoid hair products with alcohol</h2>

<p>Our first tip is to avoid hair styling products that contain alcohol during the summer. These sprays together with the sun will dry your hair further. Although our hair extensions (Art Forum Hair) are made from 100% natural human hair with the highest quality, they do not moisturize as your natural hair from the scalp. Therefore, it is good to use moisturizing hair products with UV protection, hair conditioners and masks that are suitable for your natural hair.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-staying-with-wet-hair-for-long">Avoid staying with wet hair for long</h2>

<p>It is good to dry your hair with a towel after each wash or if it is possible to use a hairdryer. You should not stay long with wet hair. It is advisable to keep your hair braided or in a low bun while swimming in the sea or in the pool to help avoid tangles. Also if you have ceratin bond hair extensions you have to avoid ponytails.</p>

<h2 id="wash-your-hair-after-swimming">Wash your hair after swimming</h2>

<p>During the summer, usually after swimming it is necessary to wash your hair more often. For the high quality hair extensions this is not a problem. You can also use a special extension-friendly brush. It has fiber that slide and do not harm the hair. However, you can use a regular brush to untangle the ends.</p>

<p>As you can see the hair extensions require almost the same care as well as our own in the summer.</p>]]></content><author><name>Albena</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Оur hair is exposed to stress with the seasons change and the new temperature conditions.

The next three practical tips are for those of you who will use hair extensions for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="make-sure-that-your-hairdresser-has-sufficient-experience-with-hair-extensions">Make sure that your hairdresser has sufficient experience with hair extensions</h2>

<p>Recently, almost every second hairdresser puts hair extensions. Though, this does not mean that he or she has sufficient knowledge and experience in this activity. We advise you not to trust the dubious beauty salons with specialists who have watched 5 videos on youtube how to put hair extensions. These hairdressers may not be able to fit them properly. Also, they are not able to advise you which hair color or hair extension methods are the best for you.</p>

<p>For this reason, your first task is to investigate whether your hairdresser has enough experience before you go ahead and accept their advice. You can get such information and recommendation from friends, acquaintances, internet.</p>

<h2 id="only-natural-human-hair">Only natural human hair</h2>

<p>For all of you who want to have beautiful hair and perfect vision it is important to use only 100% natural human hair. Only with this hair you are able to do the same thing such as your natural hair. It can be can color-dyed, curled or straightened. Of course the price for these extensions is high but the hair and the skin are some of the “accessories” which we wear with us every day. That’s why you should not make compromise with the quality.</p>

<h2 id="try-clips-in-extension-first">Try clips-in extension first</h2>

<p>If you want to put hair extensions for the first time, clips-in method is probably the best option for you. As the name suggests this method uses clips (hairpins). With their help the extension is securely attached to your natural hair. Also this method is extremely practical, fast and convenient because the hair can be removed and back attached frequently.</p>

<h2 id="sleek-straight-hair">Sleek straight hair</h2>

<p>You should use hair straightener because shiny and straight hair will be a hit in 2017. The slogan is the smoother hair, the better. Additionally, you can use liquid crystals and serums to cope with your unruly hair.</p>

<h2 id="curls---from-several-waves-to-curly-hair-like-springs">Curls - from several waves to curly hair like “springs”</h2>

<p>As аn opposite to the sleek and straight hair there is an alternative tendency for curly hair. If you have slightly wavy or curly hair you will be adorable in 2017. Again, use appropriate styling products for curly hair. According to a lot of experts the corkscrew curls look good for several days without special care for them. The curly hair is the perfect trend for all ladies who do not spend much time for their hairstyle.</p>

<h2 id="rapunzels-hair">Rapunzel’s Hair</h2>

<p>The third trend that emerged this year is long hair in all variations and hairstyles. How to achieve this effect?<br />
Do not think that if you eat only fruits and vegetables, wash your hair with quinine shampoo, use hair mask with egg yolk, olive and coconut oil you will have very long hair.

<p>Ancient Egypt is the place where a lot of beauty treatments are born. Some of them are still applied in the modern world. The Egyptians knew well and used often hair wigs. The women in the Ancient Egypt usually wore black wigs mainly on the ceremonial occasions. To make the wigs flamboyant they decorated them with ornaments of gold and ivory. Wearing a wig has been a real challenge for the body and the spirit taking into account the high temperatures during the day but beauty requires sacrifices…</p>

<p>According to some historical records ancient Greeks colored their hair with red henna. Moreover, the Greeks decorated their hair with flowers. Roman women even colored their hair blond and used bright wigs. They spent a lot of time to prepare their hair and used metal spirals for the curls. Today, a lot of women and men use hair wigs so we could say that they are always fashionable. The reasons for wearing wigs can be divided to modish and healthy. It does not matter if the wigs are made from natural human hair or artificial material the wigs are widely used in the theater and show business. A number of celebrities use wigs just to be more glamorous, unique and even unrecognizable at their stage performances.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The hair is with medium density and the structure is similar to the European one. Therefore it is very suitable for adding to the European hair.</li>
  <li>It is easily styled and color-dyed. All manipulations are good for a long time.</li>
  <li>It is with dark colors from brown to black and is usually wavy. The curled hair can be maintained or straightened with hair straightener and to be completely smoothed. This is especially important because almost always the natural hair color have to be changed depending on customer preferences who will use the hair. Perhaps only the color of the saturated black hair retained when the extensions are with the same color.</li>
  <li>It is durable. This means that even after cutting, it has a long life. There are many cases when the Indian hair extensions are used around five years.</li>
</ul>

<p>As per the above reasons it can be concluded that the Indian hair is the most suitable replacement for the European hair, especially for people with thick and hard hair. It is also the most in demand for the production of extensions.</p>

<p>On a side note, when we talk about Indian hair we often say that she is a virgin (untreated). What does that mean?</p>
