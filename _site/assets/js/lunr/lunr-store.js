        "title": "Methods for Extending Hair",
        "excerpt":"Choosing the most appropriate hair extension method depends on many factors. The most important ones are related to your hair type and the result that you want to achieve – temporary (for one night) or long term (over a month). It’s best to consult with a professional hairdresser for the most appropriate method for you in order to achieve the best result. We, at Art Forum Hair, have always individual approach to each client. For this reason we cannot plainly declare a universal method suitable for every hair type. Let’s take a look at some of the popular methods.   Clips-in hair extensions   Clips are small hairpins with silicone element through which the weft is firmly attached to the hair. This method is extremely practical, fast and convenient because the tape hair can be removed and replaced every day. The method is also suitable when you want to insert the hair extension only for special occasions such as photo shootings. This is an easy and fast way to have a long and beautiful hair.   Tape hair extensions   They are thin with invisible tape at the end. After sticking they merge with your natural hair. This method does not damage your hair.   Sewing / stitching hair extensions   This is one of the oldest methods for hair extension. The hair wefts are sewn to your hair with thread. The weft has to be lifted after 1-3 months because your natural hair grows. The sewed hair is firmly attached and looks very natural.   Keratin stands hair extension   This method using separate strands of hair extension. They have special keratin capsules, and the hair is firmly attached to the base of your natural hair. The number of the keratin strands depends on the volume which you want to have.   Caps hair extensions   The extension hair is attached to the natural hair with small eyelets with the same color. Extensions can be both rails and locks. Maintenance of hair with this method depends on the growth of your hair. Typically, about 1 - 3 months caps are moved upward to the base of the hair.   Art Forum has is proud to provide professional and high quality service in the selection of each of the above methods for hair extension.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Hair Color Trends for Spring 2017",
        "excerpt":"It’s still winter and the temperature outside is below zero with little sun if any. That’s why it’s the perfect time to change your hair color without worrying that the sun will have a negative impact on it. At the same time, Spring is not so far and the most popular hair stylists outline the latest trends in hair colors for Spring 2017. Just keep on reading to know more!   The Wheat Blonde   The wheat blond color is a complex mixture of gold and light beige. The experts say that the color is universal and suitable for different hair types and colors. If you have suitable skin complexion you will look good even with pale pink shades. Also, the color looks great to the ladies with paler skin complexion.   The “Tiger Eye” color   Tiger’s eye is an ancient stone that is worn for protection and confidence. It is known to encourage bravery, to bring passion and physical strength. The color, which is named after the color of the stone, includes a wide range of rich browns and gold colors. So, the idea in the hair coloring is to replicate the nuances that are interwoven in the stone. The technique is similar to the balayage. Also, “Tiger eye” has another great advantage - it does not require frequent visits to the hair stylist. The different shades start at the length of the hair and do not affect the roots. You can give a break to your hair and leave it to grow more. As a result you will get a great ombre effect! A lot of national and international celebrities already managed to experiment with this new trend. Now it’s your turn!   The unlimited possibilities of the black ombre hair   We always have a look at Wheat Blonde and “Tiger Eye”. Now it is time for the black hair. In this respect the fashion trends offer many possibilities in spring 2017. Again we have to trust on ombre style.

        "title": "Why Indian Hair is the Best for Extensions?",
        "excerpt":"The Indian hair is the most common type for hair extensions bеcause of the following reasons:      The hair is with medium density and the structure is similar to the European one. Therefore it is very suitable for adding to the European hair.   It is easily styled and color-dyed. All manipulations are good for a long time.   It is with dark colors from brown to black and is usually wavy. The curled hair can be maintained or straightened with hair straightener and to be completely smoothed. This is especially important because almost always the natural hair color have to be changed depending on customer preferences who will use the hair. Perhaps only the color of the saturated black hair retained when the extensions are with the same color.   It is durable. This means that even after cutting, it has a long life. There are many cases when the Indian hair extensions are used around five years.   As per the above reasons it can be concluded that the Indian hair is the most suitable replacement for the European hair, especially for people with thick and hard hair. It is also the most in demand for the production of extensions.   On a side note, when we talk about Indian hair we often say that she is a virgin (untreated). What does that mean?   Usually the hair is taken from young Indian girls who have never color-dyed, straightened or curled their hair. It has been also carefully protected from the harmful sun rays. After the cutting, the hair is not processed with anything else except being washed several times with water. Therefore it is possible to have an aroma if it has been treated with essential oils. In some cases, the hair may have single gray or white hairs too.   As a whole, the Indian virgin hair is quite healthy and shiny. Thus it very reacts well to color-dying and has a long life. It can be also conveniently purchased in a variety of conditions - of weight or treces (rows) with different sizes.   That’s why we at Artforum work only with Indian hair!  ","categories": [],

        "title": "The Hair Wigs - Before and Now",
        "excerpt":"Hair has always been a symbol of beauty and femininity. Since ancient times men and women took a special care of their hair and almost simultaneously started making wigs from different materials - natural human hair, animal fibers, etc. In this respect the history of the fashion and the wigs are inextricably linked with the history of the all humankind. In this article we will do a quick historical overview of the wigs. Finally, we will summarize what significance the wigs have for the modern woman.   Ancient Egypt is the place where a lot of beauty treatments are born. Some of them are still applied in the modern world. The Egyptians knew well and used often hair wigs. The women in the Ancient Egypt usually wore black wigs mainly on the ceremonial occasions. To make the wigs flamboyant they decorated them with ornaments of gold and ivory. Wearing a wig has been a real challenge for the body and the spirit taking into account the high temperatures during the day but beauty requires sacrifices…   According to some historical records ancient Greeks colored their hair with red henna. Moreover, the Greeks decorated their hair with flowers. Roman women even colored their hair blond and used bright wigs. They spent a lot of time to prepare their hair and used metal spirals for the curls. Today, a lot of women and men use hair wigs so we could say that they are always fashionable. The reasons for wearing wigs can be divided to modish and healthy. It does not matter if the wigs are made from natural human hair or artificial material the wigs are widely used in the theater and show business. A number of celebrities use wigs just to be more glamorous, unique and even unrecognizable at their stage performances.   In this respect, the hairstylists and the wig-makers of Art Forum Hair are wizards on the topic. We help our customer choose high quality and suiting wig. In our salon you can find natural wigs - different colors and lengths and we can also make a wig according to your preferences, requirements and personal needs.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"It is March and the modern trends in the hairstyles for 2017 are available. We review the main and the most popular of them for the year. One thing is sure – simplicity and negligence in the hairstyle are modern. Overall, again the straight and the curly hair are two competing trends.   Sleek straight hair   You should use hair straightener because shiny and straight hair will be a hit in 2017. The slogan is the smoother hair, the better. Additionally, you can use liquid crystals and serums to cope with your unruly hair.   Curls - from several waves to curly hair like “springs”   As аn opposite to the sleek and straight hair there is an alternative tendency for curly hair. If you have slightly wavy or curly hair you will be adorable in 2017. Again, use appropriate styling products for curly hair. According to a lot of experts the corkscrew curls look good for several days without special care for them. The curly hair is the perfect trend for all ladies who do not spend much time for their hairstyle.   Rapunzel’s Hair   The third trend that emerged this year is long hair in all variations and hairstyles. How to achieve this effect?  Do not think that if you eat only fruits and vegetables, wash your hair with quinine shampoo, use hair mask with egg yolk, olive and coconut oil you will have very long hair. All of these Grandma’s recipes have some positive effects but you should be aware that they do not do miracles. The truth is that not everyone’s hair root can nourish hair with a length of 80 cm.   So don’t worry if in you have not cut your hair at all and it is still short. The hair extensions are the best opportunity for you. If you want to see how you will look with long hair just come to our salon at Zlatovrah Street 23. We offer the largest variety of natural Indian hair with the highest quality.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "3 Things You should Know Before Getting Extensions",
        "excerpt":"Today a lot of ladies, and not only, use hair extensions. The next three practical tips are for those of you who will use hair extensions for the first time.   Make sure that your hairdresser has sufficient experience with hair extensions   Recently, almost every second hairdresser puts hair extensions. Though, this does not mean that he or she has sufficient knowledge and experience in this activity. We advise you not to trust the dubious beauty salons with specialists who have watched 5 videos on youtube how to put hair extensions. These hairdressers may not be able to fit them properly. Also, they are not able to advise you which hair color or hair extension methods are the best for you.   For this reason, your first task is to investigate whether your hairdresser has enough experience before you go ahead and accept their advice. You can get such information and recommendation from friends, acquaintances, internet.   Only natural human hair   For all of you who want to have beautiful hair and perfect vision it is important to use only 100% natural human hair. Only with this hair you are able to do the same thing such as your natural hair. It can be can color-dyed, curled or straightened. Of course the price for these extensions is high but the hair and the skin are some of the “accessories” which we wear with us every day. That’s why you should not make compromise with the quality.   Try clips-in extension first   If you want to put hair extensions for the first time, clips-in method is probably the best option for you. As the name suggests this method uses clips (hairpins). With their help the extension is securely attached to your natural hair. Also this method is extremely practical, fast and convenient because the hair can be removed and back attached frequently.

        "title": "How to Care for Hair Extensions in the Summer",
        "excerpt":"Оur hair is exposed to stress with the seasons change and the new temperature conditions. The main “stress” factors that influence both our natural hair and the extensions are the harmful UV rays from the sun, the sand on the beach, the salt water of the sea and the chlorine and other chemicals in the swimming pools. So during the summer it is extremely important to care for our hair and to avoid its dryness, thinning and loss of shine. Luckily, there is not much effort required or expensive procedures involved. Our mini program of 3 tips will help you for the beautiful look of your hair extensions during the upcoming hot summer!   Avoid hair products with alcohol   Our first tip is to avoid hair styling products that contain alcohol during the summer. These sprays together with the sun will dry your hair further. Although our hair extensions (Art Forum Hair) are made from 100% natural human hair with the highest quality, they do not moisturize as your natural hair from the scalp. Therefore, it is good to use moisturizing hair products with UV protection, hair conditioners and masks that are suitable for your natural hair.   Avoid staying with wet hair for long   It is good to dry your hair with a towel after each wash or if it is possible to use a hairdryer. You should not stay long with wet hair. It is advisable to keep your hair braided or in a low bun while swimming in the sea or in the pool to help avoid tangles. Also if you have ceratin bond hair extensions you have to avoid ponytails.   Wash your hair after swimming   During the summer, usually after swimming it is necessary to wash your hair more often. For the high quality hair extensions this is not a problem. You can also use a special extension-friendly brush. It has fiber that slide and do not harm the hair. However, you can use a regular brush to untangle the ends.   As you can see the hair extensions require almost the same care as well as our own in the summer.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "What are the main human hair extensions types?",
        "excerpt":"One of the latest surveys in the beauty industry reports that in the recent years people who want to use hair extensions have increased by more than 40%. At the same time, the human hair extensions are ever increasingly demanded and preferred all over the world. Indeed, natural hair extensions have the same structure as your hair, blend very well with it and their life is much longer than the synthetic ones. There are three basic types of human hair extensions that you can choose from. We will start with the highest quality hair.   Virgin human hair   Virgin human hair is the best quality hair on the market. This hair is obtained from women or young girls who have never treated their hair chemically (color-dyed) or thermal (curling, straightening) with a curling iron nor a hair straightener. Also, very often this type of hair has not been dried with a hairdryer and it is carefully kept under a headscarf. This is the highest grade hair extension and of course the price is the highest. You can do everything which you do with your own hair - color-dyed, straightening and curling.   Remy Human Hair   Almost all online stores claim that they sell only Remy human hair. What does this mean? When the hair is Ramy all hairs in the extension are arranged in the same order from the top to the root and the hair growth is preserved unchanged. Generally, the remy technology guarantees a longer life of the hair extension and protects the hair from entanglement. The lowest quality human hair follows.   Non Remy human hair   Unfortunately, in 90% of the cases the claim that the hair is Remy is an advertisement trick to justify the higher price of the hair. The non Remy hair is usually collected from hairdressing salon’s floors and it is impossible for each hair to be properly arranged (the roots in one direction and the ends in other direction). Very soon the hair extensions get tangled and become practically unusable. We hope we have been useful to you and you could already distinguish the different human hair types!  ","categories": [],

Which hair extension method is the best for you   We have already written about the hair extension methods. We at Art Forum Hair always personally approach each of our clients and we can not say which method is best for the wedding hairstyle.

They said that the hair is extremely flexible and natural-like.      Flexible   The tape-in hair extensions which we offer are extremely flexible compared to the other hair extension methods. One of the reasons for this is that the tape-in hair extensions are put near the base of the hair. Our clients share that they feel comfortable while wearing and brushing their hair. This is also true when they wash and dried their hair. In fact, the maintenance and the care for them are the same as for your own hair.

    "title": "Our Philosophy for Beautiful Hair",
    "excerpt":"The long, thick and healthy hair has always been standard for beauty and femininity. Every lady wants to have beautiful hair.  Sometimes nature is not generous with us in this regards but now we have the perfect solution for this problem. One of the easiest and quickest way to have a healthy, long and beautiful hair is by using extensions (natural hair extensions).  Natural hair extension can transform your overall look. To achieve this purpose, the extensions should be indistinguishable from your natural hair. They must have a structure and color close to your own hair.  For this reason, the quality and the manufacture of the hair are essential in our work. In our beauty studio the selection and manipulation of all hair is handmade – hair by hair from specialists with a lot of experience in this area. We trust only our own knowledge, skills and precision in drafting of the extensions. The work is time-consuming, only handmade but the result is unmatched. We always control the quality of manufactured extensions. In this respect, the beautiful hair needs an expert!  Furthermore, we offer only the highest quality extensions from natural virgin human hair. What does this mean? The virgin hair is taken by a single person. The requirements for this hair are high – not to be chemically treated (colored) or thermal (straightened or curled). This is the highest grade hair extension. Naturally, such hair will have a long life with proper maintenance by our professional hairdressers.  We know that every woman has unique hair. For this reason, in order to satisfy the requirements of our clients we have a wide assortment of straight, curly and wavy hair in various colors and lengths. The hair is the highest quality Indian hair with a long life.  The last question which probably excites you is \"What can I do with my hair extensions?\" The answer is very simple – the same things which you do with your own hair. Hair extensions can be color-dyed, curled, straightened and stylized as your own hair.  Here are the most important pieces of advice from our experts:  \\- buy only quality natural hair. Do not compromise with the quality of hair extensions.  \\- ask only experienced hairdresser which is the most suitable method and color for your extensions.  For more information or help do not hesitate to contact our consultants by phone. You are welcome in our beauty studio on \"Zlatovrah\" street 23 in Sofia.

    "title": "Tape-in Hair Extensions",
    "excerpt":"In the past, hair extensions had the reputation of expensive accessories requiring specific high-level of maintenance and frequent visits to the hairdresser. In fact, all of this does not apply to the tape-in hair extensions. For them, our customers share that once they have tried them, they can not live without them! Additionally, the tape-in hair is the best hair extension method. At the same time, it is being the most requested in the beauty salons worldwide! How did this happen? We will present three of the tape-in hair extensions secrets which made them extremely popular and sought after all over the world.  1. First, tape-in hair extensions do not look fake. They really look like your natural hair. Again, our customers share that their friends and colleagues can not believe that they have extensions. Indeed, tape-in hair extensions are completely flat, extremely comfortable and the customers often forget that they wear additional hair. With regard to the possibilities of making different hair styles, they are unlimited. You can wear your ponytail or to run your imagination and make a new wild hairstyle every day. In order your hair to look glamorous, the quality of the hair extensions is the most important. The main rule you should follow in this case is not to make compromise with the quality. Please, use only hair extensions made of 100% natural human virgin hair. If you want to touch real virgin hair, welcome to the Art Forum Hair beauty salon.  2. Secondly, the maintenance of the tape-in hair extensions is extremely easy. Again, we asked our customers how they maintain this hair extension type. All of them said that they washed, brushed up, dried, straightened, curled, and color-dyed their hair extensions. Generally, they refer to them as to their natural hair.  3. Third, but not on the last place. The stickers of the tape-in hair extensions are completely harmless to the hair and head skin. They are made of compatible and non-irritating skin products. They do not interfere to the root's growth. Also, they do not overload the scalp and they are reusable. What better than that?","url": "https://artforumhair.com/tape-in-extensions/"
