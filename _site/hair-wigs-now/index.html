<p>Ancient Egypt is the place where a lot of beauty treatments are born. Some of them are still applied in the modern world. The Egyptians knew well and used often hair wigs. The women in the Ancient Egypt usually wore black wigs mainly on the ceremonial occasions. To make the wigs flamboyant they decorated them with ornaments of gold and ivory. Wearing a wig has been a real challenge for the body and the spirit taking into account the high temperatures during the day but beauty requires sacrifices…</p>

<p>According to some historical records ancient Greeks colored their hair with red henna. Moreover, the Greeks decorated their hair with flowers. Roman women even colored their hair blond and used bright wigs. They spent a lot of time to prepare their hair and used metal spirals for the curls. Today, a lot of women and men use hair wigs so we could say that they are always fashionable. The reasons for wearing wigs can be divided to modish and healthy. It does not matter if the wigs are made from natural human hair or artificial material the wigs are widely used in the theater and show business. A number of celebrities use wigs just to be more glamorous, unique and even unrecognizable at their stage performances.</p>
