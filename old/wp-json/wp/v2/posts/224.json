Also, they are not able to advise you which hair color or hair extension methods are the best for you.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, your first task is to investigate whether your hairdresser has enough experience before you go ahead and accept their advice. You can get such information and recommendation from friends, acquaintances, internet.<\/p>\n<h2>Only natural human hair<\/h2>\n<p>For all of you who want to have beautiful hair and perfect vision it is important to use only 100% natural human hair. Only with this hair you are able to do the same thing such as your natural hair. It can be can color-dyed, curled or straightened. Of course the price for these extensions is high but the hair and the skin are some of the &#8220;accessories&#8221; which we wear with us every day. That\u2019s why you should not make compromise with the quality.<\/p>\n<h2>Try clips-in extension first<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to put hair extensions for the first time, clips-in method is probably the best option for you.
