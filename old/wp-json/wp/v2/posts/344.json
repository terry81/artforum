For this period she has created many memorable persons (images) from the advertisements and film productions. Over the last 10 years, Albena&#8217;s greatest passion are the hair extensions and the wigs. Of course they are always made of natural human hair with the highest quality. Despite of numerous engagements, Albena has been able to hold a training course for people interested in the latest hair extension methods and to share her experience in this area. During the training course almost all topics connected with the hair extensions were discussed. The course included absolutely all steps for hair extensions preparation \u2013 from the haircutting methods, stitching of the hair extensions and, of course, the different hair extension methods. One of the main topics is the latest hair extension method \u2013 tape-in hair extensions. So far, these are the most sought after hair extensions because they are extremely comfortable and harmless to your hair. Also a very interesting topic was how to care about and maintain our own hair extensions. Don\u2019t miss the chance to join the next training course organised byArt Forum.
